# Project Milestone Creation Guide (BOC-54 Proven)

## 📋 Standard Process for Milestone Creation

**Purpose**: Systematically formulate logical and executable milestones from project overview

**Procedure**:
1. **Detailed Analysis of Project Overview** (Sequential Thinking recommended)
   - Deeply understand purpose, background, scope, and expected effects
   - Clarify issues and problems to be solved
   - Identify deliverables and constraint conditions

2. **Logical Phase Division**
   - 4-6 phase configuration considering chronological dependencies
   - Design where each phase is premised on deliverables of previous phase
   - Clearly define parts that can be executed in parallel

3. **Detailed Development of Each Milestone**
   - 📍 Goal: Concise goal definition in 1-2 sentences
   - ✅ Major Tasks: Specific and executable task list
   - 🎯 Success Criteria: Objectively determinable completion conditions

## 🚀 Implementation Method: Using Linear API

**Preparation Work**:
```bash
# 1. Retrieve project list
curl -X POST "https://api.linear.app/graphql" \
  -H "Authorization: $(cat ~/.linear-api-key)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"query { projects(first: 10) { nodes { id name description } } }"}'

# 2. Identify target project ID
PROJECT_ID="[Project ID retrieved above]"
```

**Milestone Creation**:
```bash
# Linear GraphQL projectMilestoneCreate mutation
curl -X POST "https://api.linear.app/graphql" \
  -H "Authorization: $(cat ~/.linear-api-key)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { projectMilestoneCreate(input: { name: \"Milestone 1: Title\", description: \"Detailed goal description\", projectId: \"'$PROJECT_ID'\" }) { projectMilestone { id name description } success } }"}'
```

## 📊 Milestone Design Pattern (BOC-54 Proven)

**4-Phase Standard Pattern**:
1. **Foundation Building** - Infrastructure, structure, basic design
2. **Asset Migration & Integration** - Integration and standardization of existing elements
3. **Operation Establishment** - Process, automation, workflow construction
4. **Validation & Optimization** - Effect measurement, continuous improvement

**Dependency Design**:
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
     ↘         ↗ (partial parallel execution possible)
```

## ✅ Quality Checklist

**Milestone Creation Completion Conditions**:
- [ ] Project overview sufficiently analyzed with Sequential Thinking
- [ ] Clear goals, tasks, and success criteria set for each milestone
- [ ] Phase dependencies are logically designed
- [ ] Milestones are actually created on Linear
- [ ] Correspondence with expected effects can be clearly explained

**Failure Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Only comment additions without actual milestone creation
- ❌ Overly abstract goal setting
- ❌ Parallel design without considering dependencies
- ❌ Subjective and ambiguous success criteria

## 🔄 Application Example: BOC-54

**Project**: AI Assistant Knowledge Hub
**Created Milestones**: 4 (each ID recorded)
**Result**: Formally created on Linear, immediately executable
